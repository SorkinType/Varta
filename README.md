Varta
=====

Varta is a Sans Serif family that fuses warm humanity with bright clarity and professional crispness. Its congenial personality emerges at larger sizes.
The family is offered in four of the four most commonly used weights to ensure broad utility. Each weight has been designed to render well down to surprisingly small sizes and on both low and high-quality screens.
Varta is well suited to a broad range of tasks including sign systems, editorial design, packaging and extended reading on screens.
