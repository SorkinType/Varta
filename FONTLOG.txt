This file provides detailed information on the Varta 
font Software.

fonts and any derivative works.

Font Information

Varta offers a compelling sensibility made possible by the clever fusing of a
warm humanity with a distinct clarity and profesional crispness. The net effect
is to both calm and to cheer the reader. As Varta is seen at larger sizes its
congenial personality emerges. Varta is well suited to a broad range of tasks
including sign systems, editorial design, packaging and extended reading on
screens. Varta is offered in four of the the four most commonly used weights to
ensure broad utility. Each weight has been designed to render well down to
surprisingly small sizes and on both low and high quality screens.

Varta is an evolving project. As of now there are 4 styles: 

Light
Regular
SemiBold
Bold
